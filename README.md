# PResNet
Pseudo-ResNet (PResNet) is a simplified version of the ResNet deep learning architecture applied to the MNIST dataset, intended to help me build experience using skip connections and CNNs generally. Given that ResNet is intended to optimize very deep networks, whereas this model only has 7 layers (compared to the 100+ of the original ResNet), this model is impractical. Thus, its development is purely for educational purposes. The model utilizes a modified portion of the of original ResNet architecture, included within this repo as a screenshot. It was developed using PyTorch. The original paper describing ResNet can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385
